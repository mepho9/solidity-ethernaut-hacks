# Solidity Ethernaut Hacks

This repository contains my solutions to the [Ethernaut](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/) challenges â€” a set of Solidity hacking puzzles that help improve smart contract security understanding.

---

## Overview

Each folder corresponds to a specific Ethernaut level, containing the challenge contract(s) and my attack solution(s) with detailed comments explaining the logic and exploitation steps.

The goal is to provide clear, concise, and educational code to help anyone learn how these vulnerabilities work.

## How to Use

1. Browse the folder for the challenge you want to study.
2. Each folder contains the original challenge contract and an attack contract.
3. The attack contract includes detailed comments explaining the approach and logic.
4. You can deploy and test the solutions using your preferred Solidity environment.
