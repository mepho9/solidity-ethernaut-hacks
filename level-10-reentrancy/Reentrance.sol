/**
 * Ethernaut Level 10 - Reentrance
 *
 * Goal: Drain all Ether from the contract using a reentrancy attack.
 *
 * Approach:
 * - The withdraw() function sends Ether before updating the userâ€™s balance.
 * - This allows us to re-enter withdraw() before our balance is set to 0.
 * - We deploy a contract that donates to itself, then repeatedly calls withdraw().
 * - Each reentrant call extracts more funds before the balance is reduced.
 *
 * An external contract (ReentranceAttacker.sol) was used for this level.
